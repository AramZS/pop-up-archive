        <media:description>Q&amp;A McKinley &amp; Beattie / Nokor China / Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said China is in close touch with North Korea on the issue of a detained Chinese fishing boat urging Pyongyang to "deal with this as soon as possible" and protect the fishermen's legal rights and personal and property safety. A Chinese official says the private vessel from Dalian City in China's northeast Liaoning province was "grabbed" by North Korea earlier this month (May 5) in waters between the two countries. The vessel reportedly has a crew of 16 and Pyongyang has demanded a $100,000 payment for their release. Australian National University senior lecturer Michael McKinley tells Victor Beattie such incidents may show either disarray within the North Korean leadership or a rise in bilateral tensions</media:description><media:group>

        <media:description>Q&amp;A Williams &amp; Mildren / Bangladesh Burma / The United Nations says it is working with the governments of Bangladesh and Burma to prepare their disaster response procedures ahead of a cyclone. The U.N. said late Tuesday Cyclone Mahasen is expected to make landfall late Friday north of the Bangladeshi city of Chittagong, near the Burmese border. The international agency said there are "fears" Mahasen "could threaten millions of people" in northeast India, Bangladesh, and Burma's Rakhine State, where tens of thousands of internally displaced people are currently living in temporary shelters. Kirsten Mildren is the regional communications officer with the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Speaking from Bangkok, she tells VOA&#x2019;s Sarah Williams about the efforts to prepare for the storm.</media:description><media:group>

        <media:description>Q&amp;A Tin Maung Htoo &amp; Beattie / US Burma / state television has announced that President Thein Sein will travel to the United States next week. The trip will reportedly include a visit with U-S President Barack Obama at the White House next Monday. U.S. officials have not publicly confirmed the visit, which follows President Obama's historic trip to Burma last November. Thein Sein was permitted to travel to New York to attend the opening session of the U.N. General Assembly session last September. The last Burmese leader to visit Washington was Ne Win NAY WIHN in 1966, nearly 50 years ago. Tin Maung Htoo, of the non-governmental organization Canadian Friends of Burma tells Victor Beattie, while Burma seeks a deeper economic relationship, the trip could prove useful for Washington seeking to counterbalance China's growing influence in Burma.</media:description><media:group>

        <media:description>Q&amp;A Paal &amp; Beattie / US China Japan / The Washington-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace last week warned that China's growing military power poses challenges to Japan, the U.S./Japan alliance and regional security. While the assessment sees a China/Japan conflict as unlikely, it says China could achieve its maritime objectives through what it calls "coercive power." While it does not foresee an Asia-style "Cold War," or a major strategic shift in the Asia-Pacific region for the next 15 to 20 years, the Carnegie report warns the increasing presence of Chinese air and naval assets near Japan heightens the risk of a crisis. Co-author Douglas Paal tells VOA's Victor Beattie the key for Japan's claims to the Senkakus will depend largely on its economic resurgence and increasing its defense spending.</media:description><media:group>

        <media:description>Q&amp;A Kessler &amp; Beattie / Malaysia Pol / Malaysia's ruling National Front coalition remains in power today (Monday) after Sunday's election, amid growing ethnic polarization in the Southeast Asian nation. Prime Minister Najib Razak's nah-JEEB RAH-zahk governing coalition held 133 seats in the 222-seat parliament, while the opposition coalition of Anwar Ibrahim captured the other 89 seats. On Sunday, Anwar initially refused to concede defeat complaining the country's election commission was complicit in electoral fraud. There were complaints the ink to mark voters could be easily washed off and reports of foreigners flown into the country to cast ballots. Clive Kessler, an emeritus professor at Australia's University of New South Wales, speaking from Kuala Lumpur, tells VOA's Victor Beattie the outcome was not a surprise, but a huge disappointment to the opposition as this was widely viewed at its best chance to end the National Front's grip on power.</media:description><media:group>

        <media:description>Q&amp;A Case &amp; Beattie / Malaysia Pol / More than 13-million Malaysians are eligible to vote in what many analysts expect to be a historic election Sunday (May 5). The contest could see the ruling coalition of Prime Minister Najib Razak nah-JEEB RAH-zahk turned out for the first time since independence more than 50 years ago. Mr. Razak's National Front coalition, which has been in power for 56 years, faces a tough challenge from the three-party coalition led by ex-Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. The opposition alliance took an unprecedented number of seats during the 2008 elections that saw the National Front lose its two-thirds majority for the first time. William Case, a Southeast Asia analyst with the City University of Hong Kong, has been in Malaysia observing the campaign for a week and, on board a bus, told VOA's Victor Beattie he sees a level of excitement across the country.</media:description><media:group>

Bae was detained on November 3 as he entered the northeastern port city of Rason, which lies in a special economic zone near the border with Russia and China. The official Korean Central News Agency said the man, whose Korean name is Bae Jun Ho, confessed to unspecified crimes that it said were "proven through evidence." Human Rights Watch deputy Asia director Phil Robertson tells VOA's Victor Beattie, barring some diplomatic breakthrough, Bae may remain a long time in North Korea.</media:description><media:group>

        <media:description>Q&amp;A Roy &amp; Beattie / China U.S. / The top U.S. military officer, meeting in Beijing with his Chinese counterpart, Monday insisted a strong U.S. presence in the Asia-Pacific region provides a "stabilizing influence." Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman General Martin Dempsey, the first chairman to visit China in four years, met with his Chinese counterpart, General Fang Fenghui, in Beijing. China has objected to the so-called U.S. "rebalance" suspecting it is intended to contain China, a rising global power. Both officers expressed an interest in a more enduring and deeper military-to-military relationship, which has, in the past, been interrupted by political disputes.

        <media:description>Q&amp;A Dahgaypaw &amp; Beattie / Burma Japan / Burmese democracy leader and parliamentarian Aung San Suu Kyi has finished a week-long visit to Japan.

        <media:description>Q&amp;A Schwartz &amp; Beattie / China Economy Asian markets and commodities continued the slide today (Tuesday) begun by European and U.S. markets a day before, in part the result of Monday's announcement that China's economy expanded at 7.7% in this year's first quarter rather than at the 8% many analysts had expected. China, the world's second-largest economy, is also one of the globe's biggest importers of commodities, such as oil and metals. The relatively weak growth number coupled with weak economic data from the United States and Europe have sent commodity prices plunging, with gold losing more than $140 Monday, its worst one-day loss in 30 years. Gold has fallen to $1361 an ounce, after reaching its all-time high of $1900 in August, 2011. Oil futures fell below $90 for the first time since December and have lost 8% in the last two weeks. Stephen Schwartz, chief Asia economist for the Hong Kong-based Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, tells VOA's Victor Beattie there is no doubt analysts were disappointed by the 7.7% first quarter growth rate in China, but he still expects the Chinese economy to outperform official forecasts.</media:description><media:group>

        <media:description>Every day, three babies, on average, are abandoned in Johannesburg alone. They are thrown into dumpsters and left for dead -- often by desperate mothers who can't afford to raise them. Now, a local NGO called "Door of Hope" has opened what it calls a "baby bin". It allows mothers to leave their babies and know they will be taken care of. Emilie Iob reports for VOA News from Johannesburg.</media:description><media:group>

        <media:description>Q&amp;A Robertson &amp; Beattie / Burma Violence / Muslim rights group has condemned what it calls the increasing anti-Muslim propaganda and organized killings of Muslims in Burma, as reports of sectarian violence in central Burma spread south toward the administrative capital, Naypyidaw (NAY-pih-daw). The Arakan Rohingya National Organization released a statement Saturday saying police and security forces did nothing to control riots in Meikhitila (MEK-till-uh), where Buddhist-Muslim clashes last week left at least 32 people dead. The violence began Wednesday, when an argument between a Buddhist customer and a Muslim shopkeeper spilled into the street. By Friday, entire neighborhoods had been burned to the ground, mosques had been reduced to ashes and gangs of Buddhists and Muslims roamed the streets. Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch in Bangkok told VOA's Victor Beattie the government does not seem yet to have the situation under control.</media:description><media:group>

        <media:description>Q&amp;A Villanueva &amp; Beattie / Hong Kong Foreign Domestic Workers / Hong Kong's highest court today (Monday) unanimously overturned a lower court ruling granting foreign domestic helpers the right to seek permanent residency status, or "right of abode" in the Chinese territory. The ruling brings a long legal battle to an end. The Court of Final Appeal ruled 5-0 that "the nature of foreign domestic helpers' residence in Hong Kong is highly restrictive" and they are obliged to return to their country of origin at the end of their contract and "admission is not for the purposes of settlement and that dependents cannot be brought to reside in Hong Kong." The case for permanent residency was brought by two Filipino domestic workers (Evangeline Banao Vallejos and Daniel Domingo), who had petitioned for permanent residency and had worked in the financial hub since the mid-1980s. These workers claim they face discrimination and lack legal protection from abusive employers. Eman Villanueva (vee-ah-noo-aye-vuh), secretary-general of United Filipinos in Hong Kong, was in the courtroom to hear the verdict. He tells VOA's Victor Beattie the years-long case impacts hundreds of thousands of domestic workers in the Chinese territory.</media:description><media:group>

        <media:description>Q&amp;A Malik &amp; Beattie / US Japan China / A U.S. defense official has confirmed that Japanese and American military officers will discuss plans to counter any Chinese military action to seize disputed islands in the East China Sea. Japanese media reports of the planning prompted a Chinese defense ministry vow of a "steadfast" defense of its territorial integrity. The Pentagon-based official told VOA Wednesday that Japan's General Shigeru Iwasaki, chief of staff of the Japanese Self Defense Forces Joint Staff, will meet this week with the commander of the U.S. Pacific Command, Admiral Samuel Locklear, to discuss a plan to retake the islands, should China invade. Lieutenant Colonel Cathy Wilkinson said the two are meeting for "regular alliance consultations." She added that the Defense Department does not discuss its military planning efforts and encourages China and Japan to resolve the dispute over the islands "through peaceful means." China and Japan have a long-running dispute over the tiny, uninhabited islands, known as the Senkaku in Japan and the Diaoyu in China. Both countries claim the islands, which Japan controls. They are surrounded by rich fishing grounds and possibly by energy deposits. Mohan Malik is a professor of Asian security at the Hawaii-based Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies. He tells VOA's Victor Beattie this is not the first such meeting of its kind and says military exercises were abandoned last year under pressure from China when news of the plan was leaked to the media.</media:description><media:group>

        <media:description>Q&amp;A Gallo &amp; Currie / China Tibet / Police in central China are denying that a woman set herself on fire earlier this month to protest Chinese rule in Tibet, saying instead she was murdered by her husband who later set the body on fire. Today's Communist Party-controlled Global Times quoted a police official in Aba, in Sichuan province, as saying the husband, Dolma Kyab, strangled his wife, following a fight about his alcohol addiction. The official says the man burned her gasoline-drenched body a day later, adding he was "certain the case was not a protest against Chinese policy," as earlier reported by several international news outlets and Tibetan exile groups. Alastair Currie is the spokesman for the British-based Free Tibet. He tells VOA's William Gallo about the controversy.</media:description><media:group>

        <media:description>Q&amp;A Sato &amp; Beattie / US Koreas / Yoichiro Sato, Japanese defense analyst at Ritsumeikan Asia-Pacific University, says the B-52 missions show the North the United States has the pre-emptive capability of responding to any imminent North Korean provocation. He was asked by Victor Beattie if Japan welcomes the over flights. Sato says there has been a debate among observers in Japan that Tokyo might pursue a more independent strategy in dealing with the North Korean nuclear threat. However, he says policymakers will likely pursue an enhanced U.S./Japan alliance, not move away from it. He says Tokyo views the American nuclear deterrent as the most effective way to prevent a North Korean attack.</media:description><media:group>

Most news media here have said the last papal resignation occurred 600 years ago but Martens says that is not correct. He told me it has been nearly 800 years since a Pope resigned and he explained to VOA&#x2019;s Paul Westpheling how he and other lawyers come to that conclusion.</media:text>

        <media:description>Q&amp;A Westpheling Martens Cardinals Meeting -- The Roman Catholic College of Cardinals begins meeting today in Rome to discuss issues ahead of their conclave to elect a successor to Pope Benedict XVI. But this is not the beginning of the conclave ... a name given to the meetings when Cardinals actually vote on a successor to the man now called ... Pope Emeritus. For an explanation of the process VOA&#x2019;s Paul Westpheling turned to Kurt Martens. He is a professor or Canon Law - or the law of the Catholic Church - at the Catholic University of America here in Washington</media:description><media:group>

Dozens of followers of the so-called 'Sultan of Sulu' have occupied a Malaysian coastal village for three weeks. The violence has prompted Kuala Lumpur to beef up security forces in Sabah.

However, he says Manila has placed the claim on the back burner, especially in light of the more recent territorial dispute with China over islands in the South China Sea.

        <media:description>Q&amp;A Morrison &amp; Beattie / U.S. Sequestration Asia / U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and U-S Secretary of State John Kerry Wednesday sounded the alarm over the impact on America's foreign and security policy caused by automatic spending cuts, known as sequestration. The cuts are set to take effect March 1st in a budget battle between President Obama and Congress. Charles Morrison, president of the Hawaii-based East-West Institute, was asked by VOA's Victor Beattie if, in light of Washington's budgetary impasse, he shares Mr. Kerry's view that the United States must continue leading as the world's "indispensable nation." Morrison says the impact of sequestration in Asia would involve such things as U.S. export promotion efforts. He calls the spending cuts "foolishly made" and not reflecting America's long-term interests.</media:description><media:group>

The movie has earned more than $570 million in ticket sales, many of them from outside the United States. Lee previously won the Best Director Oscar in 2005 for the film Brokeback Mountain, becoming the first Asian to be so honored. Lisa Lu is the first Chinese-born actress to star in major motion pictures in Hollywood and on television. The actress was born in Beijing in 1927, and moved to California in the 1950's. She has appeared in the films The Mountain Road, The Last Emperor and Lust Caution, the last directed by Ang Lee. VOA&#x2019;s Sarah Williams spoke with her recently at her home in Los Angeles, where she was preparing to travel to China for the Beijing premiere of her latest film Dangerous Liaisons.

        <media:description>Q&amp;A Sin &amp; Beattie / China Kobe Bryant / In yet another sign of the explosive popularity of basketball in China, American professional player Kobe Bryant of the Los Angeles Lakers stirred up plenty of excitement after opening an account on the Chinese-language micro blogging website, Sina (see-nuh) Weibo (way-boh), with an estimated 400-million users. Bryant's first message Friday morning (February 14) was a cryptic reference to the Lakers' game that night against the Los Angeles Clippers. His Chinese followers numbered in the hundreds of thousands within hours. Bryant is widely known and hugely popular in China having posted a message a few days earlier marking the Lunar New Year on the Weibo account of Nike Basketball. Named Black Mamba, he wished his followers a happy New Year. Ben Sin, a Hong Kong and U.S./based freelance journalist, has been following the growing basketball phenomenon in China for years. It has been underscored by the success of former Shanghai Sharks and Houston Rockets player Yao Ming who retired from Houston after eight seasons in 2011. Ben Sin tells VOA's Victor Beattie basketball is becoming, or has already become, the most popular sport in China.</media:description><media:group>

        <media:description>&amp;A Tan &amp; Beattie / Singapore Protest / Thousands rallied in Singapore Saturday over a controversial immigration plan by the ruling People's Action Party (PAP), which calls for a dramatic increase in foreign workers as a way to maintain the city-state's economic competitiveness. The plan was approved by parliament earlier this month. Last month, the government of Singapore issued a controversial "white paper" on population in which it called for an increased immigration flow over the next 20 years. Foreigners could make up nearly half a population of about 6.9-million by 2030. Eugene Tan, an assistant law professor at Singapore Management University, tells VOA's Victor Beattie the protesters are concerned about what they see as the dilution of Singaporean identity. Today, he says permanent residents make up more than half the current 5.2-million population.</media:description><media:group>

        <media:description>Q&amp;A Petrov &amp; Beattie / US-UN-Nokor / On Monday, the United States warned of further consequences should North Korea make good on its threat to conduct another nuclear test. South Korea's U.N. ambassador, Kim Sook, told reporters a nuclear test appears to be imminent and promised a swift U.N. Security Council response. The U.S./based website 38 North says Pyongyang's nuclear site is in a high state of readiness to conduct another nuclear test. North Korea has threatened to conduct its third nuclear test and carry out more rocket launches in retaliation for a tightening of U.N. Security Council sanctions against Pyongyang over its December rocket launch. Some analysts say North Korea's provocative behavior is a warning to South Korea's incoming administration not to continue its current tough policy against the North. Leonid Petrov, Korea researcher at the Australian National University, tells VOA's Victor Beattie the North sees its nuclear program as part of the Korean conflict, which only ended in an armistice in 1953.</media:description><media:group>

        <media:description>Q&amp;A Williams &amp; Richardson / China Rights / In China, a court has ruled in favor of a group of villagers detained in the country's so-called "black jails" after traveling to Beijing to lodge complaints with the central government. The official Xinhua news agency said 10 people were convicted today of illegally detaining the petitioners, who had traveled to the capital from central Henan province. The court said the defendants "falsely imprisoned" the petitioners for several days in two courtyards in Beijing last April. It gave them jail sentences ranging from six months to two years, saying they "infringed the personal rights" of the petitioners. It also ordered them to pay an unspecified amount of compensation. Sophie Richardson is China director at Human Rights Watch. VOA&#x2019;s Sarah Williams asked her whether this latest ruling signifies any changes in Chinese justice.</media:description><media:group>

        <media:description>As China scrambles to respond to the choking smog that has blanketed Beijing in recent weeks, authorities in several major cities are experimenting with so-called carbon-trading markets. The schemes allow air polluters to buy and sell official permits for their harmful carbon emissions, and create strong incentives to cut these climate-changing pollutants. Carbon trading is the latest effort to get control over run-away greenhouse gases in an economy still hungry for cheap energy. Shannon Van Sant reports from Beijing.</media:description><media:group>

        <media:text>HEADLINE: Malawi Moves to Make Rainy Season Cholera-Free TEASER: Health authorities engage in water purification initiative INTRO: In Malawi, health authorities have engaged in an exercise that seeks to combat cholera outbreaks anywhere in the country. In the past, Malawi&#x2019;s rainy seasons have been characterized by cholera outbreaks and death. From Blantyre VOA&#x2019;s Lameck Masina has the story. TEXT: Cholera is often spread by eating food contaminated by germs from human waste. Symptoms of the disease include diarrhea, vomiting and dehydration. Those who do not have access to a hospital or clinic for rehydration therapy may die. Statistics from the Health Ministry show that three years ago, the water-borne disease killed 24 out of 2,000 people infected. A year later, the number dropped to 60 cases and 4 deaths. This year, health authorities want the number to be zero. Henry Chimbali is the spokesperson for the ministry. /// Chimbali Act 1 /// &#x201C;The first thing is to provide [free] safe and treated water to people so they can use it in their homes by distributing chlorine and also promoting [a sodium hypochlorite solution called] Water Guard especially in areas where access to safe water is limited&#x201D;. /// End Act /// Chimbali says the ministry has intensified community education on the construction and utilization of toilets to avoid the unsafe disposal of human waste which may help spread cholera-causing germs. He says the country is likely to win the battle based on records showing no districts in the northern and southern regions have had any cholera in the past years. Harold Kabuluzi is spokesperson for Dedza District Hospital in Malawi&#x2019;s central region.. /// Kabuluzi Act /// &#x201C;We do intensify health education all over the districts and again we distribute cholera materials in time like chlorine and other things to all the people [in the district]&#x201D;. /// End Act /// Chimbali says to win the fight at the national level the government is working with various partners including international NGOs and the media. /// Chimbali Act 3 /// &#x201C;Fearing there could be some shortfalls in medical supplies, we have different partners including UNICEF have shops that are supported by USAID. They have been in forefront in the provision of some cholera supplies. The media must be oriented so that they understand what cholera is all about. [Next, they must educate the public about how to prevent the disease.]&#x201D; /// End Act /// So far, there have been no outbreaks this rainy season -- giving hope that the national wide fight against cholera will be won.</media:text>

        <media:description>Q&amp;A Bird &amp; Beattie / Burma Debt / In another sign Burma is emerging from many years of isolation, the country has been able to clear interest on decades of past debt. The funds were owed to the World Bank and Asian Development Bank (ADB), and totalled nearly $1 billion. Burma also reportedly secured debt write-off of billions more from members of the Paris Club of creditor nations. That amount could reach nearly $6-billion. Burma's total external debt on loans made back in the 1970s and 1980s could be as high as $11-billion. However, the announcements today give a boost to President Thein Sein's efforts at reforming the nation and follow the lifting of sanctions by Western nations. Economist Kelly Bird of the Manila-based Asian Development Bank tells VOA's Victor Beattie the bank's relationship with Burma will be phased in over the next two years. He says more than $500-million in arrears by Burma has been cleared with the help of the Japan Bank for International Cooperation, or JBIC.</media:description><media:group>

        <media:description>Q&amp;A Lipin &amp; Meacham / Dreamliner / This week, aviation authorities around the world grounded the Boeing 787 Dreamliner passenger jet following a safety warning issued by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration. Airlines in Chile, India and Europe are the latest to stop flying the jet, which already has been grounded in the U.S. and Japan. The FAA, which sets the standard for global aviation regulators, warned that the next generation plane should not fly until the risk of battery fires is addressed. The move came after one of the twin-engine, wide-bodied planes was forced to make an emergency landing in Japan when a cockpit warning indicated a battery malfunction and passengers smelled something burning. Michael Meacham is the senior edtior at Aviation Weekly and Space Technology. He tells VOA's Michael Lipin what kind of impact this will have on the future of the Dreamliner.</media:description><media:group>

Jia Qinglin, who heads China's top political advisory body, made the comments during a meeting with former Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama. The state-run China Daily quoted Jia as saying Beijing places "great importance" on its ties with Japan, and that the dispute should be resolved in order to preserve regional stability. His remarks are in contrast to Beijing's recent hard-line rhetoric on the long-running dispute, which has worsened significantly in the past few months, with both sides sending fighter jets to patrol the islands.

        <media:description>Tensions between India and Pakistan over the disputed Kashmir territory have escalated in recent days, after Islamabad blamed New Delhi for killing one of its soldiers late Tuesday. It is the latest in a series of attacks that have left at least two Pakistani and two Indian soldiers dead. India's Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh, Tuesday said bilateral relations cannot be "business as usual" in the wake of these border incidents. Raghbendra Jha, executive director of the Australian South Asia Research Center, tells VOA's Victor Beattie what Mr. Singh's statement means.</media:description><media:group>
