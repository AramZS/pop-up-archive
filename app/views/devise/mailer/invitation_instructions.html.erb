<p>Hello <%= @resource.email %>!</p>


<p>We’re excited to offer you a special preview of <%= root_url %>!</p> 

<p>What does it mean to beta test? To begin, we’ll let you loose in the archive. You can create your own public or private collections, view automatically generated transcripts and keywords, and search your own sounds or a range of collections from producers, stations, and archives.<br />
There's a "Feedback" feature on the site where you can ask questions, and of course you can email us anytime. We’ll follow up with a short survey and updates as ready. We’re releasing new features all the time.</p>

<p>As for you? Have fun, ask questions, complain, be honest. We really want to know what you like, what you don’t like, what goes wrong or is unclear, and what features you’d like to see in the future or just aren't  useful for you.<br />
Your input is crucial in order for Pop Up Archive to reach its full potential. Don’t hold back!</p>
