    p Pop Up Archive accepts CSV spreadsheets where each row represents one item, and columns are used for descriptive fields.
    p You can attach audio files to each row by creating a "Digital Location" column and pasting comma-separated links to the files (for example, on your server or Dropbox public folder).
    p If you have a pre-existing spreadsheet, try to match your fields with the Pop Up template spreadsheet.
