    p The web is getting noisier. Too much of our past is trapped on servers and hard drives, untranscribed, unfindable — and, worst of all, unheard. Pop Up Archive organizes your sound so that it can be found and reused, no matter where it lives. We’re inspiring a new generation of storytellers with simple sound management tools that let stories speak for themselves.

      |But memories fade, and audio can easily get lost or degrade. When it’s easy to archive, it’s easy to find the threads that create stories. Who knows when you’ll find a use for all the great content in that lengthy interview?

      |We’re paying close attention to the lifecycle of digital sound in the wild. We want to share our learning with you: through blog posts, webinars, open source software contributions and a free public plan. Before the digital age, organizing sound was tough and time-consuming, with little payoff. But we’re entering a new frontier of sound. Organization means new creative opportunities and wider distribution.

      span.whitepop Built to work. 
      |We’ve done the heavy lifting and put lots of tools in one place: transcription, cataloging, storage, preservation, web formatting, and processing huge backlogs of digital sound. Our tools are lightweight, so they work for the everyman and some of the biggest media collections in the world — without requiring anyone to change existing systems. We’ve tested the tools through rigorous user-centered design. Our pilot subjects include radio producers and stations, oral history archives, and media distributors.
