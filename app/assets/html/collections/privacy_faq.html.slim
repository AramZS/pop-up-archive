	h2 What is a public collection? 
	p
		|Media in public collections is stored on servers at the Internet Archive. Like a public library, the Internet Archive stores media and makes it available at no cost to researchers, historians, and scholars. Anyone can see or hear this media through 
		a href="http://popuparchive.org" target="blank" Pop Up Archive’s website
		|, or download it from the 
		a href="http://archive.org" target="blank" Internet Archive. 
		|No one can download material directly from the 
		a href="http://popuparchive.org" target="blank" Pop Up Archive website.

	h2 What is a private collection? 
	p Media in private collections is stored on private Amazon S3 servers maintained by Pop Up Archive. A private collection can be seen and heard only by the person who created it. Private team collections (coming soon) can only be seen and heard by team members who have been granted access by the team administrator. 

	h2 What is the Internet Archive?
	p 
		a href="http://archive.org" target="blank" The Internet Archive 
		|focuses on preservation and providing access to digital cultural artifacts. Like a public library, 
		a href="http://archive.org" target="blank" the Internet Archive 
		|stores media and makes it available at no cost to researchers, historians, and scholars. People (like you!) can contribute content to 
		a href="http://archive.org" target="blank" the Internet Archive 
		|if it's in the public domain or if you own the rights to it. If you own the rights, we recommend that you choose a license for it and/or provide contact information so that others will know how they may (or may not) use it.

	h2 Who can access my audio if it’s in a public collection?
	p 
		|Anyone can access audio in a public collection through 
		a href="http://popuparchive.org" target="blank" Pop Up Archive’s website 
		|as well as through 
		a href="http://archive.org" target="blank" the Internet Archive’s website
		|, or download it from 
		a href="http://archive.org" target="blank" the Internet Archive’s website
		|. No one can download material directly from 
		a href="http://popuparchive.org" target="blank" the Pop Up Archive website.

	h2 Who can access my audio if it’s in a private collection?
	p A private collection can be seen and heard only by the person who created it. Private team collections (coming soon) are only visible to team members who have been granted access by the team administrator. 

	h2 Can I change the privacy setting of a collection?
	p 
		|No, but you can delete a collection and all of the audio in that collection will be deleted from the Internet Archive’s servers (or from Pop Up Archive’s servers, in the case of private collections). Even when an audio file is deleted from 
		a href="http://archive.org" target="blank" the Internet Archive
		|, textual information about that file will continue to exist in search engine indexes. For this reason, we encourage you to be mindful of sensitive audio.

	h2 Why can’t I change the privacy setting of a collection?
	p 
		|When you create a public collection, any textual information (i.e. title, description) about the audio files in that collection is also stored on the Internet Archive’s servers, and that textual information gets indexed very frequently by Google and other search engines. This is great news when it comes to making material easier to find on the web. But it also means that even when an audio file is deleted from 
		a href="http://archive.org" target="blank" the Internet Archive
		|, textual information about that file will continue to exist in search engine indexes. For this reason, we encourage you to be mindful of sensitive audio.

	h2 I accidentally added audio to a public collection, but I want it to be private. Now what?
	p You can delete the collection and all of the audio in that collection will be deleted from the Internet Archive’s servers. Then, create a private collection and add the audio to your new private collection. The new private collection will only be accessible to you. Keep in mind: even after you delete a public collection, textual information about that collection may continue to exist in search engine indexes. For this reason, we encourage you to be mindful of sensitive audio.

	h2 How can I use the public audio I find in Pop Up Archive?
	p Part of the reason we built Pop Up Archive was to encourage discovery of archival audio. Anything in a public Pop Up Archive collection is indexed by search engines and can be seen and heard by the public. Through Pop Up Archive, thousands of hours of hidden sonic treasure is seeing the light of day for the first time.
